#Last Train

Last Train is a simple web app that allows a user to plan their last journey of the evening using the TFL API. Enter a place of departure, or click 'Get My Location' to allow geolocation, then specify your destination and Twilio-registered phone number, then you should see a list of possible journeys. On choosing a journey, you can decide whether to receive a text with directions right now, or an hour before departure.
